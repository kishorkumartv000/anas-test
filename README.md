This Telegram Bot, based on [python-aria-mirror-bot](https://github.com/lzzy12/python-aria-mirror-bot), has undergone
substantial modifications and is designed for efficiently mirroring or leeching files from the Internet to various
destinations, including Google Drive, Telegram, or any rclone-supported cloud. It is built using asynchronous
programming in Python.

see [Using Service Accounts](https://github.com/anasty17/mirror-leech-telegram-bot#generate-service-accounts-what-is-service-account) section below. Default is `False`.

- `FFMPEG_CMDS` (`Dict`): Dict of list values of ffmpeg commands. You can set multiple ffmpeg commands for all files before upload. Don't write ffmpeg at beginning, start directly with the arguments. `Dict`
  - Examples: {"subtitle": ["-i mltb.mkv -c copy -c:s srt mltb.mkv", "-i mltb.video -c copy -c:s srt mltb"], "convert": ["-i mltb.m4a -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 mltb.mp3", "-i mltb.audio -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 mltb.mp3"], extract: ["-i mltb -map 0:a -c copy mltb.mka -map 0:s -c copy mltb.srt"], "metadata": ["-i mltb.mkv -map 0 -map -0:v:1 -map -0:s -map 0:s:0 -map -0:v:m:attachment -c copy -metadata:s:v:0 title={title} -metadata:s:a:0 title={title} -metadata:s:a:1 title={title2} -metadata:s:a:2 title={title2} -c:s srt -metadata:s:s:0 title={title3} mltb -y -del"], "watermark": ["-i mltb -i tg://openmessage?user_id=5272663208&message_id=322801 -filter_complex 'overlay=W-w-10:H-h-10' -c:a copy mltb"]}
  **Notes**:
  - Don't add ffmpeg at the beginning!
  - Add `-del` to the list which you want from the bot to delete the original files after command run complete!
  - To execute one of those lists in bot for example, you must use -ff subtitle (list key) or -ff convert (list key)
  **Example**:
  - Here I will explain how to use mltb.* which is reference to files you want to work on.
  1. First cmd: the input is mltb.mkv so this cmd will work only on mkv videos and the output is mltb.mkv also so all outputs is mkv. `-del` will delete the original media after complete run of the cmd.
  2. Second cmd: the input is mltb.video so this cmd will work on all videos and the output is only mltb so the extenstion is same as input files.
  3. Third cmd: the input in mltb.m4a so this cmd will work only on m4a audios and the output is mltb.mp3 so the output extension is mp3.
  4. Fourth cmd: the input is mltb.audio so this cmd will work on all audios and the output is mltb.mp3 so the output extension is mp3.
  5. FFmpeg Variables in last cmd which is metadata ({title}, {title2}, etc...), you can edit them in usetting
  6. Telegram link for small size inputs like photo to set watermark.

- `NAME_SUBSTITUTE` (`Str`): Add word/letter/character/sentense/pattern to remove or replace with other words with sensitive case or without. 
  **Notes**:
    - Before any character you must add `\BACKSLASH`, those are the characters: `\^$.|?*+()[]{}-`
    * Example: script/code/s | mirror/leech | tea/ /s | clone | cpu/ | \[mltb\]/mltb | \\text\\/text/s
    - script will get replaced by code with sensitive case
    - mirror will get replaced by leech
    - tea will get replaced by space with sensitive case
    - clone will get removed
    - cpu will get replaced by space
    - [mltb] will get replaced by mltb
    - \text\ will get replaced by text with sensitive case

**3. GDrive Tools**

- `GDRIVE_ID` (`Str`): This is the Folder/TeamDrive ID of the Google Drive OR `root` to which you want to upload all the mirrors using google-api-python-client.

```
sudo docker compose stop
```

- To run the container:

```
sudo docker compose start
```

- To get log from already running container (after mounting the folder):

```
sudo docker compose logs --follow
```

------

</details>

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
1. Flush your machine iptables to use your opened ports with docker from the host network. 

```
# Flush All Rules (Reset iptables)
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -X
sudo iptables -t nat -F
sudo iptables -t nat -X
sudo iptables -t mangle -F
sudo iptables -t mangle -X

sudo ip6tables -F
sudo ip6tables -X
sudo ip6tables -t nat -F

```

2. Set `BASE_URL_PORT` and `RCLONE_SERVE_PORT` variables to any port you want to use. Default is `80` and `8080`
   respectively.

3. Check the number of processing units of your machine with `nproc` cmd and times it by 4, then
   edit `AsyncIOThreadsCount` in qBittorrent.conf or while bot working from bsetting->qbittorrent settings.

  <summary><h5>Getting Google OAuth API credential file and token.pickle</h5></summary>

**NOTES**

- Old authentication changed, now we can't use bot or replit to generate token.pickle. You need OS with a local browser.
  For example `Termux`.
- Windows users should install python3 and pip. You can find how to install and use them from google or from
  this [telegraph](https://telegra.ph/Create-Telegram-Mirror-Leech-Bot-by-Deploying-App-with-Heroku-Branch-using-Github-Workflow-12-06)
  from [Wiszky](https://github.com/vishnoe115) tutorial.
- You can ONLY open the generated link from `generate_drive_token.py` in a local browser.

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
3. Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
4. Choose Desktop and Create.
5. Publish your OAuth consent screen App to prevent **token.pickle** from expiring.
6. Use the download button to download your credentials.
7. Move that file to the root of mirrorbot, and rename it to **credentials.json**
8. Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
9. Search for Google Drive API and enable it
10. Finally, run the script to generate **token.pickle** file for Google Drive:

```
pip3 install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```

------

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h5>Generating rclone.conf</h5></summary>

1. Install rclone from [Official Site](https://rclone.org/install/)
2. Create new remote(s) using `rclone config` command.
3. Copy rclone.conf from your systemâ€™s config directory into the repo root. For example:

------

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h5>Upload</h5></summary>

- `RCLONE_PATH` is like `GDRIVE_ID` a default path for mirror. In additional to those variables `DEFAULT_UPLOAD` to
  choose the default tool whether it's rclone or google-api-python-client.
- If `DEFAULT_UPLOAD` = 'rc' then you must fill `RCLONE_PATH` with path as default one or with `rcl` to select
  destination path on each new task.
- If `DEFAULT_UPLOAD` = 'gd' then you must fill `GDRIVE_ID` with folder/TD id.
- rclone.conf can be added before deploy like token.pickle to repo folder root or use bsetting to upload it as private
  file.
- If rclone.conf uploaded from usetting or added in `rclone/{user_id}.conf` then `RCLONE_PATH` must start with `mrcc:`.
- Whenever you want to write path manually to use user rclone.conf that added from usetting then you must add
  the `mrcc:` at the beginning.
- So in short, up: has 4 possible values which are: `gd` (Upload to GDRIVE_ID), `rc` (Upload to RCLONE_PATH), `rcl` (Select Rclone Path) and `rclone_path` (remote:path (owner rclone.conf) or `mrcc`:remote:path (user rclone.conf))

------

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h5>UPSTREAM REPO (Recommended)</h5></summary>

- `UPSTREAM_REPO` variable can be used for edit/add any file in repository.
- You can add private/public repository link to grab/overwrite all files from it.
- You can skip adding the private files like token.pickle or accounts folder before deploying, simply
  fill `UPSTREAM_REPO` private one incase you want to grab all files including private files.
- If you added private files while deploying and you have added private `UPSTREAM_REPO` and your private files in this
  private repository, so your private files will be overwritten from this repository. Also if you are using database for
  private files, then all files from database will override the private files that added before deploying or from
  private `UPSTREAM_REPO`.
- If you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with the official repository link, then be careful in case any change in
  requirements.txt your bot will not start after restart. In this case you need to deploy again with updated code to
  install the new requirements or simply by changing the `UPSTREAM_REPO` to you fork link with that old updates.
- In case you you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with your fork link be careful also if you fetched the commits from the
  official repository.
- The changes in your `UPSTREAM_REPO` will take affect only after restart.

  <summary><h5>Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit</h5></summary>

> For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = "True" in config file or environment variables.
> **NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

<details>
  <summary><h3>1. Generate Service Accounts. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts">What is Service Account?</a></h3></summary>
Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need.

**Warning**: Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of
projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your
projects banned by Google.

> **NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:

```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

> **NOTE:** 1 Service Account can upload/copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can
> upload 75 TB a day.

> **NOTE:** All people can copy `2TB/DAY` from each file creator (uploader account), so if you got
> error `userRateLimitExceeded` that doesn't mean your limit exceeded but file creator limit have been exceeded which
> is `2TB/DAY`.

#### Two methods to create service accounts

Choose one of these methods

<details>
  <summary><h5>1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)</h5></summary>

- List your projects ids

```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```

- Enable services automatically by this command

```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```

- Create Sevice Accounts to current project

```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```

- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder

```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h5>2. Create Service Accounts in New Project</h5></summary>

```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

</details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3>2. Add Service Accounts</h3></summary>

#### Two methods to add service accounts

Choose one of these methods

<details>
  <summary><h5>1. Add Them To Google Group then to Team Drive (Recommended)</h5></summary>

- Mount accounts folder

```
cd accounts
```

- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
- `For Windows using PowerShell`

```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>emails.txt
```

- `For Linux`

```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > emails.txt
```

- Unmount accounts folder

```
cd ..
```

Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add this Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to
manager and delete email.txt file from accounts folder

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h5>2. Add Them To Team Drive Directly</h5></summary>
